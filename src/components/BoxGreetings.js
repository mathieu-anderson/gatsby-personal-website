        <p>
          I'm a <Emphasis>front-end</Emphasis> specialist. Love being part of
          cross-functional teams and being the{" "}
          <Emphasis>logical bridge</Emphasis> between the back-end devs and the
          designers. Iâ€™m very proficient with <Emphasis>React</Emphasis>, but I
          love building UIs in a <Emphasis>declarative way</Emphasis>,
          regardless of the tool. And always eager to adopt whatever is
          consensual with the team! Coming from a{" "}
          <Emphasis>fullstack background</Emphasis>, I am familiar with back-end
          tech (Node, Go, SQL), and delighted to dig in when needed!
